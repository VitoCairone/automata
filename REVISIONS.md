I believe this code is accurate in terms of results, and has some features which make it easier to modify,
such as getter and iterator methods for cells in grid which means we can accomplish most things
without worrying about how the data is stored. However, overall I spent most time trying to
solve the problem and debug, so there could easily be much better organization here into
an object-oriented style or some encapsulation to avoid conflicts or polluting namespaces
were this script to be run in context with others.

Given more time, I also would have liked to provide better visualization of actual evolution
over time with a simple front-end of color-changing CSS elements in a grid. Since the
solution is already in JavaScript, that should not be a large additional effort.
